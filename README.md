## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Log in using an authorized GCP account
```bash
gcloud auth login
```
For example
```bash
> gcloud auth login --no-launch-browser
You are running on a Google Compute Engine virtual machine.
It is recommended that you use service accounts for authentication.
You can run:
  $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`
to switch accounts if necessary.
Your credentials may be visible to others with access to this
virtual machine. Are you sure you want to authenticate with
your personal account?
Do you want to continue (Y/n)?  y
Go to the following link in your browser:
    https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?redirect_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Awg%3Aoauth%3A2.0%3Aoob&prompt=select_account&response_type=code&client_id=32555940559.apps.googleusercontent.com&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.email+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fcloud-platform+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fappengine.admin+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fcompute&access_type=offline

Enter verification code:

You are now logged in as [user@example.com].
Your current project is [None].  You can change this setting by running:
  $ gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
```
